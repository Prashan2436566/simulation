1. Environment
Your environment is a 30×30 toroidal grid (MultiGrid), meaning agents can wrap around edges.

Resource patches

Renewable:

Regenerate over time (regen_rate) if renewables_regenerate is enabled.

Can be overused — overuse triggers a cooldown and environmental scar effects that slow regeneration.

Collapses (is removed) if scar level passes a threshold.

Non-renewable:

Higher yield than renewables but no regeneration.

Mining increases environmental scars in nearby renewables.

Scar system (environmental degradation):

Mining non-renewables increases scar_level in surrounding renewables.

Scar reduces renewable regeneration (scar_regen_alpha).

Scar decays slowly over time but can lead to resource collapse.

Infrastructure sites

Placeholder for future R&D/infrastructure mechanics (e.g., mining hubs).

2. Agent Types
All agents are instances of IdeologyAgent with an ideology label determining behaviour:

"capitalist" — prioritise highest yield minus cost, often choose non-renewables first.

"socialist" — share resources via the community_pool more readily, may mine evenly.

"green_capitalist" — like capitalist but factor in environmental costs (scar_avoid_alpha) and receive subsidies for renewables.

"green_socialist" — like socialist but with environmental awareness.

"communist" — likely resource sharing across all, centralised control (depends on your implementation).

"adaptive" — can change behaviour based on conditions (if implemented).

3. Economic & Social Systems
Energy as currency

Agents start with some energy and spend it to mine resources.

Mining yield differs by resource type (yield_per_mine_...) and costs (cost_extract_...).

Community Pool (redistribution mechanism for socialist-like systems)

Funded by tithe rate (tithe_rate) from mined resources.

Redistributed every redistribute_every steps to agents below a share_floor.

Basic income (basic_income) given to all agents each step.

Carbon Tax & Renewable Subsidy (environmental policy)

Carbon tax applied per unit of non-renewable extracted.

Renewable subsidy per unit of renewable extracted.

Primarily for “green” ideologies.

4. Data Collection & Graphs
The model tracks:

Economic metrics: AvgEnergy, CommunityPool, AgentsAlive

Environmental metrics: TotalScar, Renewables, NonRenewables, InfrastructureSites

Equality metric: GiniEnergy

Mining outputs: MinedRenewable, MinedNonrenewable

Your server.py shows live charts for:

Economy (energy levels & pool size)

Environment (scar & resource counts)

Mining rates (renewable vs non-renewable extracted per step)

Equality (Gini coefficient over time)

Optional ideology population chart (if enabled in model.py)

5. Possible R&D / Infrastructure Features
If you add R&D / infrastructure decisions:

Agents could choose to invest in:

Renewable tech — increase regen rate or yield.

Extraction tech — reduce cost per mine.

Pollution control — lower scar effects.

Exploration tech — improve efficiency finding resources.
Could be implemented as:

self.consider_research_innovation() → modifies agent's future performance.

self.consider_infrastructure_building() → places special infrastructure (like EnergyHub) with global/local benefits.
